## Usage

The application will prompt the user to create or select a vehicle.  Creation will lead to a series of prompts in which the user will input the typeof vehicle, make, model, color, weight, and top speed.  Once a new vehicle is created, it will be selectable from the list of existing vehicles. The user can perform actions with the vehicle from the action menu once a vehicle has been selected.
